Grab What's Inside
==================

Libraries that Grab uses
------------------------

In short, Grab is a wrapper on top of two powerful libraries: lxml and pycurl.

* The pycurl library allows to configure and perform synchronous and asynchronous network requests.
* The lxml library allows you to work with a DOM tree of an HTML document. It allows you to select elements with XPATH expressions.

Beside these two libraries, Grab uses multiple libraries from the Python standard library.
I recommend that you study the lxml library for better understanding of how Grab selectors work. Thanks
to the lxml developers, who wrote great documentation: http://lxml.de/
